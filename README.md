This program uses the backtracking algorithmn, along with the pandas library, to find a path that ends in any of the zone 12 states (CA, OR, NV, or WA) with the minimum number of parks you want to visit. The path can start at any state, the direction that we can only go is west, and only one state per zone can be visited. Here is an example below that demonstrates the output expected.

Three csv files have been provided that help me determine the path cost from state to state, the zone of each state, and the states that we can visit from one particular state to another

Here is another sample output of a path that was not found: (AL 30)
