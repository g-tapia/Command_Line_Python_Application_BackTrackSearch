This program uses the backtracking algorithmn, along with the pandas library, to find a path that ends in any of the zone 12 states (CA, OR, NV, or WA) with the minimum number of parks you want to visit. The path can start at any state, but the direction that we can only go towards, is west. Here is an example below that demonstrates the output expected.

Three excel sheets have been provided that help us determine the path cost from state to state, the zone of each state, and the states that we can visit from one particular state

Here is another sample output of a path that was not found: (AL 30)

You have to be pretty crazy to want to visit 30 parks!


Fell free to run this py file, and if you want a more detailed description, then you can refer to the documents above.
